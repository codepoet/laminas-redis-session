# Laminas redis session example

This skeleton provides a `docker-compose.yml` for use with
[docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/); it
uses the provided `Dockerfile` to build a docker image 
for the `laminas` container created with `docker-compose`.

Build and start the image and container using:

```bash
$ docker-compose up -d --build
```

At this point, you can visit http://localhost:8080 to see the site running.
